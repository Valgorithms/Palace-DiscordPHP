**This fork is dedicated to maintaining the code used by Palace Bot#9203, which runs on the teamreflex/DiscordPHP API library. You can choose to self-host your own instance of this bot or invite my hosted instance to your server. If hosting your own instance, it is advisable to merge all -include.php files into run.php to remove the read overhead of loading a file every time it is needed **OR** the preferred method of enabling JIT via opcache in PHP's config. Please note that doing so will require the bot to be restarted any time a change is made to it.**

# Before you start
Before you start using this Library, you **need** to know how DiscordPHP works, how PHP works, and how ReactPHP Event Loops and Promises work. This is a fundamental requirement before you start. Without this knowledge, you will only suffer.

See https://github.com/elazar/asynchronous-php for resources.

# Why is this bot open-source?
Because there's no reason not to. I made it to do something useful for my community and figured it would be a good learning experience for others.

# Can I contribute to development?
Sure! If you find something wrong please create an issue if you discover one. If you have a new feature or want to change how something works create your own fork and make a pull requests. Please let me know before you decide to implement a new feature as there's a possibility I may have already written one with another bot I'm maintaining that I can import.

# Can I fork it and distribute my own bot?
Yep! I'm issuing this code under the MIT license. I don't care what you do with it, so long as you credit me as the original author.

# How much would it cost for you to host this bot for me?
I'm not in it for the money, but donations are always appreciated. You can either sponsor [VZGCoders](https://github.com/sponsors/VZGCoders) or [me](https://github.com/sponsors/valzargaming) directly. You can invite the bot to your server and ask me for any help you might need at any time and I'll do my best to get back to you.

# How can I support development?
Developing and maintaining bots like this one takes time and hard work. If you want to support the various projects I work on please consider [donating](https://github.com/sponsors/valzargaming). Telling your fellow server owners about it helps us too! The main thing that stalls development for us is lack of user feedback.
